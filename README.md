# Why fork it?
This is just Sortify but without the ability to print out annoying log files every time it sorts your files, and it sorts everything inside Download/Sortify/ instead of 0/Sortify/
Please use the original Module by [xCaptaiN09](https://github.com/xCaptaiN09) if you don't care for either of these changes, I will also keep this updated with the original as long as its doesn't have these as options by default
